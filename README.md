### 🎬 Main Screen

This is the main screen of the Amazon Prime website, displaying multiple movies. Users can select different language sections to watch movies and web series in their preferred languages.

### 🛍️ Product Identification and Purchase

This video demonstrates how a customer spots an item and wants to get it easily while enjoying the series. Using the extended X-Ray feature, the items are displayed, and users can be redirected to the product on Amazon for purchase.
